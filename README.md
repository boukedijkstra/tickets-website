# Tickets Website
Project created to learn and practice front-end technologies. This project builds a prototype of an website to buy tickets for amusement parks. Because of the scope of this project, I am only worrying about client technologies in this implementation. Hence, topics such as databases, security, authorization, payment handling, have not been developed in this project.

* Please make sure to visit [LEARNINGGOALS.md](./LEARNINGGOALS.md) for a clear outline of the learning goals of this project.

## General info
* This webshop assumes that its userbase uses the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge and other up to date browsers.
* This project will focus only on the files inside the `client` folder.
	
## Technologies
Project utilizes:
* Node.js 14.2.0
* JScript
* CSS
* HTML

## Setup
1. Fork and clone this repo to your desktop,  go to its root directory and run ``` npm install ``` to install all the project dependencies defined in `package.json`.
2. Run ``` node main.js ``` in the project directory and the website should open at **localhost:8000** in your browser.
	* If you need to use another port number change it in main.js at ``` app.listen(8000, () => console.log('Example app listening on port 8000!')) ```
3. Play around on the website and have a look at my code and my improvement over time. Feedback is super welcome!
